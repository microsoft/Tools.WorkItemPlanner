# Repo docs

This folder is for documentation only.

Please use Visual Studio Code to author documentation  (File > Open Folder > Select repo root).

Make sure to install all recommended extensions when prompted by Code:

## Best practices

1. Make sure you've resolved all green squiggles triggered by markdown linter,
   before checking in.
1. Press `Alt-Q` on long paragraphs to wrap them, so the documentation is
   readable event without markdown previewer.
1. If you want to follow the sentence with an image, check out how [devbox setup
   doc](devbox/index.md) is doing that (the line above the image has 2 trailing
   spaces, to make image appear on the next line correctly).
