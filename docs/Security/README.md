# Threat model

Threat models give us a picture of how pieces of the stack interact with one
another. If the diagram is accurate, then security and compliance teams can
effectively evaluate it and identify likely spots for vulnerabilities and
optimizations. By keeping this up to date, we do the right thing for the
customer (by protecting their data) **and** for Microsoft (by protecting our
assets).
